# utilities
A Python3 module for reusable functions that programmers may find themselves using in most or all programs they create.

## Functions and features
This module contains a number of utilities that can be used to speed up and make code easier to develop. This includes a selection of sorting algorithms and the option to display a graph that shows how the sort is carried out, which can be used for debugging or educational purposes.
There are many more featues such as searching algorithms, averages and much more.

For the full list, use `dir(utilities)` in the python shell for a list of features.

To see the full details about how a feature/function works, use `print(funcname.__doc__)` to see a formatted string explaining parameters and behaviour.

# Help
## How to install
It is recommended that you run `install.py`, however you can manually install the module by copying `utilities.py` to the `Lib` folder located in your python directory. To check for this directory, run `import os` and then `os` in your python shell.
